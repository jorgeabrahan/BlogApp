# (CRUD) Blog Posts - Front End

Full-Stack web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. The application is built using React v16 (with class components and hooks components), OAuth2, SCSS, Redux, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 

## Prerequisites

This project is built using React v16. To ensure compatibility, you need to use Node.js version 14. Follow these steps to change your Node.js version using Node Version Manager (nvm):

### Steps to change Node.js version using nvm

1. **Install nvm (Node Version Manager):** If you donâ€™t have nvm installed, please refer to the nvm GitHub repository for installation instructions.

2. **Install Node.js v14:** Use nvm to install Node.js version 14:

```bash
nvm install 14
```

3. **Use Node.js v14:** Set Node.js v14 as the active version:

```bash
nvm use 14
```

4. **Verify Node.js Version:** Ensure that you are using the correct version of Node.js:
